Consider a set of unique "Math Flash Cards" each representing an integer.
The problem is to re-order a subset of the cards to form a "lesson" consisting of 1 or more simple addition equations.

For example, if you have the cards 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, and you wish to generate a lesson consisting of 2 equations, a valid result would be:

1 + 5 = 6,
3 + 4 = 7

with the card for "2" not being used.
